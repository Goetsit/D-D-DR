# D-D-DR
Laura's Dungeons and Dragons and Disaster Recovery Table Top Adventure 

<b>Goal: Infrastructure is often very reactive and this is our opportunity to proactively go through scenarios to help better prepare ourselves as individuals and as an infrastructure team to address not just disaster scenarios but the impact a disaster can have.

Key point to remember: We can't plan for every disaster, but we can plan for impact such as critical systems or staff being unavailable.
</b>


Rules:
- This is a Table Top Recovery Test, this is meant to be a walk through with no actual cutover of systems.
- If simulation is being done online, please ensure one person speaks at a time. I understand that this can slow things down, but I want to ensure everyone has their voice heard and everyone else can understand what is going on and when.
- Please do not actually break anything
- Although this is a twist on your standard DR simulation, please keep speaking points and language professional (you can drop your F bombs when a real disaster happens)
- Ask questions and collaborate, this is a team based event - so be a team!
- During scenario initiative, if you cannot/do not have anything to add or do simply say "pass" and move on to the next person in the order.

<b> DRM Notes: </b> 

There will be notes for the DRM at the top of each module, tables can be found at the bottom of the document.

Depending on the number of participants, have each person or "team" roll initiative (1d20), highest goes first.

Scenarios will be run in initiative order, to help ensure proper speaking time. you can remain in this order or change it up at your discretion.

As a DRM, keep in mind the actions your "players" take and how that can impact a situation. For example, how would the scenarios be impacted when someone isn't communicated with?

Roll with the punches and think creatively.

These scenarios run under the assumption that a basic Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan are established.

Before beginning establish the following  "Roles"

- The "Leader" - the person is generally regarded as the executor of the business continuty plan (generally a manager of some sort)
- Department Heads/Team Leads - the point of contact for each "team"
- "Team" members
- Note taker, preferably someone who does not need to participate in the table top scenarios exstensively

We start off the adventure in a classic setting... the favorite watering hole called "Your Home Office". A quaint tavern that looks different to every patron, it's quite a magical feat really.
It's a beautiful (Day/Night), you're enjoying your favorite snacks, and sharing pictures of your pets, kids, or the cool new enchanted vacuum you got from the "Bedroll, Bath, and Beyond" down the street that was having a close-out sale.
You were all invited out to go grab a drink with your mutual good friend, Gill Bates. Gill realizes that even though you're all his greatest and most trusted friends, no one here knows anyone else! He recognizes that in an environment where some folks are local and some are remote, it can lead to disaprity in working relationships!

Gill asks everyone to say hi to each other and wants everyone to give us the following information:

- Introductions:

    - Names, Current location, "team" (DBA, Sys Admin, etc), Manager
 
    - Something that's your favorite (it could be your favorite food, your favorite sports team, your favorite color, your favorite song/band, your favorite month of the year etc)



- Establish key contacts:
      - Internal or external points of contact:
          - Example:
             - Chief Technology Office:
                 - Name:
                 - Phone Number:
                 - Email:
             - SRE Director:
                 - Name:
                 - Phone Number:
                 - Email:
             - Emergency Services: 911
