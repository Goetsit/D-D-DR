# D-D-DR
Laura's Dungeons and Dragons and Disaster Recovery Table Top Adventure 

<b>Goal: Infrastructure is often very reactive and this is our opporunity to proactively go through a disaster and find and address gaps before a real disaster actually happens. This is also our opportunity to understand our duties not only as individuals but as an entire team to ensure stability to the best of our abilities. This is about us as people.</b>


Rules:
- This is a Table Top Recovery Test, this is meant to be a walk through with no actual cutover of systems.
- If simulation is being done online, please ensure one person speaks at a time. I understand that this can slow things down, but I want to ensure everyone has their voice heard and everyone else can understand what is going on and when.
- Please do not actually break anything
- Although this is a twist on your standard DR simulation, please keep speaking points and language professional (you can drop your F bombs when a real disaster happens)
- Ask questions and collaborate


Introduction:
DRM (Disaster Recovery Master)

Welcome adventurers, to the world of "GO"
Here, human capital is prized and jobs are found in stores.
Largest Export: ACHs
Largest Import: Fireball

** DRM before beginning, depending on the number of participants, have each person or "team" roll initiative (1d20), highest goes first.
Scenarios will be run in initiative order, to help ensure proper speaking time. 

<b> Module 1: A Warmup for the People </b>

We start off the adventure in a classic setting... the favorite watering hole called "Your Home Office". A quaint tavern that looks different to every patron, it's quite a magical feat really.
