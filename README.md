# D-D-DR
Laura's Dungeons and Dragons and Disaster Recovery Table Top Adventure 

<b>Goal: Infrastructure is often very reactive and this is our opportunity to proactively go through scenarios to help better prepare ourselves as individuals and as an infrastructure team to address not just disaster scenarios but the impact a disaster can have.

Key point to remember: We can't plan for every disaster, but we can plan for impact such as critical systems or staff being unavailable.
</b>


Rules:
- This is a Table Top Recovery Test, this is meant to be a walk through with no actual cutover of systems.
- If simulation is being done online, please ensure one person speaks at a time. I understand that this can slow things down, but I want to ensure everyone has their voice heard and everyone else can understand what is going on and when.
- Please do not actually break anything
- Although this is a twist on your standard DR simulation, please keep speaking points and language professional (you can drop your F bombs when a real disaster happens)
- Ask questions and collaborate, this is a team based event - so be a team!
- During scenario initiative, if you cannot/do not have anything to add or do simply say "pass" and move on to the next person in the order.

-----

<b> DRM Notes: </b> 

There will be notes for the DRM at the top of each module, tables can be found at the bottom of the document.

Depending on the number of participants, have each person or "team" roll initiative (1d20), highest goes first.

Scenarios will be run in initiative order, to help ensure proper speaking time. you can remain in this order or change it up at your discretion.

As a DRM, keep in mind the actions your "players" take and how that can impact a situation. 
For example, how would the scenarios be impacted when someone isn't communicated with?
It might feel silly, but ensure actions are explicitly stated. This scenario is not running under the "assumption" that someone tells someone else. All steps are important and should not be left up to assumption and imagination.

Roll with the punches and think creatively.

These scenarios run under the assumption that a basic Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan are established.

Before beginning establish the following  "Roles"

- The "Leader" - the person is generally regarded as the executor of the business continuty plan (generally a manager of some sort)
- Department Heads/Team Leads - the point of contact for each "team"
- "Team" members
- Note taker, preferably someone who does not need to participate in the table top scenarios exstensively
-----



<b> Module 1 (optional): Communication and Documentation is key! </b>

-----

<b> DRM Notes: </b> 

This is just a tiny little run through to get people going. 

We are looking to establish the expectation that people know where their business continuty plan is, there should be several copies available. 

Additionally establish other documentation as well - for example an inventory of critical systems or a call tree.

General gist here is that our friend Gill is having just a hard time with his Blink Dog who keeps eating all of his documentation. Let's help Gill get his life together.

Welcome adventurers, to the world of "GO"

Here, human capital is prized and jobs are found in stores.

Largest Export: ACHs

Largest Import: Fireball

Population: A non-zero number

We start off the adventure in a classic setting... the favorite watering hole called "Your Home Office". A quaint tavern that looks different to every patron, it's quite a magical feat really.
It's a beautiful (Day/Night), you're enjoying your favorite snacks, and sharing pictures of your pets, kids, or the cool new enchanted vacuum you got from the "Bedroll, Bath, and Beyond" down the street that was having a close-out sale.
You were all invited out to go grab a drink with your mutual good friend, Gill Bates. Gill realizes that even though you're all his greatest and most trusted friends, no one here knows anyone else! He recognizes that in an environment where some folks are local and some are remote, it can lead to disaprity in working relationships!

Gill asks everyone to say hi to each other and wants everyone to give us the following information:

- Introductions (if needed):

    - Names, Current location, "team" (DBA, Sys Admin, etc), Manager
 
    - Something that's your favorite (it could be your favorite food, your favorite sports team, your favorite color, your favorite song/band, your favorite month of the year etc)


After making introductions you all find end up chatting happily amongst yourselves. 
To the first person in established initiative or a random choice: Gill has reached out to you and he's a bit paniced,  "Hey, my blink dog ate business continuity plan, do you have yours readily available and if so... where?"

>> The point of this question is to prompt people to confirm that they have a phsycial and/or digital copy of their business continuity plan. If one or both are missing, what can we do to make sure they have access to this?

Gill responds : "Great, also btw, my blink dog is wondering if you have an electronic and/or physical inventory of critical systems... think you can help me out with answering that one?"

>> This is disaster recovery. Everyone involved should have access to an inventory of our critical systems. We shouldn't be relying on tribal knowledge or sticky notes on your desk. If any team does not hhave an inventory, how can they get one?

Gill pops back into our DMs and says: "Yo, one more thing, my call tree is blank, send me a picture of yours plzzzzzzz"

>> Ensure your BC has an up-to-date call tree



<b> Module 2: Let's get this scenario started. </b>

<b> DRM Notes: </b>

Disaster Table - your main scenario, this is the big one (fire, weather, global pandemic, cyberattack, etc) start here 
Random Occurence Table - Inject some fun in this, you can start the scenario with a couple random occurences to spice things up and then sprinkle them in as you go.
