# D-D-DR
Laura's Dungeons and Dragons and Disaster Recovery Table Top Adventure 

<b>Goal: Infrastructure is often very reactive and this is our opporunity to proactively go through a disaster and find and address gaps before a real disaster actually happens. This is also our opportunity to understand our duties not as individuals but as an entire team to ensure stability to the best of our abilities. </b>


Rules:
- This is a Table Top Recovery Test, this is meant to be a walk through with no actual cutover of systems.
- If simulation is being done online, please ensure one person speaks at a time. I understand that this can slow things down, but I want to ensure everyone has their voice heard and everyone else can understand what is going on and when.
- Please do not actually break anything
- Although this is a twist on your standard DR simulation, please keep speaking points and language professional (you can drop your F bombs when a real disaster happens)
