# D-D-DR
Laura's Dungeons and Dragons and Disaster Recovery Table Top Adventure 
<h2>AS OF 2/27/2024 - this is a WIP</h2>

<b>Goal: Infrastructure is often very reactive and this is our opportunity to proactively go through scenarios to help better prepare ourselves as individuals and as an infrastructure team to address not just disaster scenarios but the impact a disaster can have. We cannot plan for a dragon attack, but the point isn't to plan for that, we want to plan for impact on essential systems, processes, and communications. You better believe a dragon attack is going to impact at least one of those things!
</b>


Rules:
- This is a Table Top Recovery Test, this is meant to be a walk through with no actual cutover of systems.
- If simulation is being done online, please ensure one person speaks at a time. I understand that this can slow things down, but I want to ensure everyone has their voice heard and everyone else can understand what is going on and when.
- Please do not actually break anything
- Although this is a twist on your standard DR simulation, please keep speaking points and language professional (you can drop your F bombs when a real disaster happens)
- Ask questions and collaborate, this is a team based event - so be a team!
- During scenario initiative, if you cannot/do not have anything to add or do simply say "pass" and move on to the next person in the order.

<b> DRM Notes: </b> 

There will be notes for the DRM at the top of each module, tables can be found at the bottom of the document.

Depending on the number of participants, have each person or "team" roll initiative (1d20), highest goes first.

Scenarios will be run in initiative order, to help ensure proper speaking time. you can remain in this order or change it up at your discretion.

As a DRM, keep in mind the actions your "players" take and how that can impact a situation. 
For example, how would the scenarios be impacted when someone isn't communicated with?
It might feel silly, but ensure actions are explicitly stated. This scenario is not running under the "assumption" that someone tells someone else. All steps are important and should not be left up to assumption and imagination.

Roll with the punches and think creatively.

These scenarios run under the assumption that a basic Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan are established.

Before beginning establish the following  "Roles"

- The "Leader" - the person is generally regarded as the executor of the business continuty plan (generally a manager of some sort)
- Department Heads/Team Leads - the point of contact for each "team"
- "Team" members
- Note taker, preferably someone who does not need to participate in the table top scenarios exstensively

| Roll        |Disaster     |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1           | An ancient red dragon has decided that the data centers shouldn't exist, starting with your pimary location. Fire is blazing. |
| 2           | Despite our best efforts in a phishing campaign, someone fell for a cyber-mimic. We are dealing with a cyberattack  |
| 3           | A wizard used the wrong components for a spell and as a result a significant number of people have been turned into crows. The wizard is calling this CORVID-19. civil infrastructure is a mess, essential communication is made far more difficult etc|
| 4           | The "Big Bad Evil Guy" is preparing to teleport the entire state or region where all of your stuff is into the astral realm. Good news, he gave you 1d4 days to get out (what a nice guy), better start moving! |
| 5           | Ok, good news and bad news, the good news... your primary systems are all good. Awesome. However, someone made a deal with asmodeus and now all of our backups are gone and secondary/DR systems are no more. Essentailly, we have no redundancy. Let's hope nothing else goes wrong! Right...nothing else will go wrong?! |
| 6           | Some swanky vampire named Astarion convinced the new hire to hand over all of your infrastructure diagrams, data, config files, passwords, secret keys... the whole shebang... This is a big ol' data breach.|
